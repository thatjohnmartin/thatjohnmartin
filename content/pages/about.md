These days, I design and build things at [Measure](http://measureprotocol.com). Previously I 
was the CEO at Crowd Science, a company I founded in 2008 with
[John Wainwright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wainwright_(computer_scientist))
and [Paul Neto](http://blog.paulneto.com). At Crowd Science we built analytics and machine learning-based
targeting engines for online publishers. We sold the company to [YuMe](http://www.yume.com) in 2013.

Prior to founding Crowd Science I was part of the engineering teams at
[comScore](http://www.comscore.com/) and [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com) as well as a handful of
startups in Sydney and Toronto.

I have a degree in Computer Science from the [University of Sydney](http://www.usyd.edu.au/) but
spent most of my time doing Philosophy. It turns out that free will does _not_ exist.

Also, I like to [climb](https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmartin78/sets/72157637739904054/)
