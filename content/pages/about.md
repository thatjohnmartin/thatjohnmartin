These days, I design and build things at [YuMe](http://www.yume.com), a digital video advertising
behemoth that acquired my startup, Crowd Science. I founded Crowd Science in 2008 with
[John Wainwright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wainwright_(computer_scientist))
and [Paul Neto](http://blog.paulneto.com) and we built machine learning-based prediction engines
for online publishers.

Prior to founding Crowd Science I was part of the engineering team at
[comScore](http://www.comscore.com/) and [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com) as well as a handful of
startups in Sydney and Toronto.

I have a degree in Computer Science from the [University of Sydney](http://www.usyd.edu.au/) but
spent most of my time doing Philosophy. It turns out that free will does _not_ exist.

Also, I like to [climb](https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmartin78/sets/72157637739904054/)

Email me at [john@lonepixel.com](mailto:john@lonepixel.com) or eat my tweets at

I also write [Technically, Advertising](http://technicallyadvertising.com), a blog about advertising.
