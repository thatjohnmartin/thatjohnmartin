I tinker at [YuMe](http://www.yume.com), a digital video advertising behemoth that acquired my little startup, Crowd Science. I founded Crowd Science in 2008 along with [John Wainwright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wainwright_(computer_scientist)) and [Paul Neto](http://blog.paulneto.com) and we built machine learning-based prediction engines for online publishers.

Prior to founding Crowd Science I was part of the engineering team at [comScore](http://www.comscore.com/) and [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com) as well as a handful of startups in Sydney and Toronto.

I have a degree in Computer Science from the [University of Sydney](http://www.usyd.edu.au/) with a very major minor in Philosophy.

I'm a [Utilitarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer) (in theory), a free will skeptic (depending on your definition of free will), and I like to [climb rocks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmartin78/sets/72157634961327591/).
