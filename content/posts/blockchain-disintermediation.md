Title: Blockchain Disintermediation

In general, blockchain technology — the public ledger, self-executing smart contracts, and cryptographic tokens — plus the willingness of cryptographic currency speculators to finance public protocol projects provide us with a set of software and economic and game theoretic tools with which middlemen can be replaced.

However, markets can be more or less susceptible to disintermediation in this way. In particular:

* automation and decentralization may be more or less possible;
* the market good or service may be more or less fungible;
* market participants may be more or less likely to switch providers;
* market participants may be more or less amenable to using cryptographic tokens as a unit of exchange; and
* the margin extracted by middlemen may be more or less egregious.
