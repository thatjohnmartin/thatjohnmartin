I've been thinking a lot about advertising in terms of [first principles][] lately. One of the
things I've been wondering about is the ways in which advertising can be a net positive on the
world. I think there are three:

1.  _Advertising can be useful for finding out about products and services._

    Obviously. The best example of this is Google's search ads.

2.  _Advertising can be entertaining._

    Whether or not a particular ad is useful, it can be entertaining. There are many sub-genres of
    this. Ads can be entertaining in the same way that content or art can be entertaining, i.e. they
    can be funny, inspiring, educational, beautiful, titilating, arresting, etc. Super Bowl ads are
    usually great examples of this.

3.  _Advertising can support great content and endeavors._

    It's hard to do a controlled experiment here and be certain that a world devoid of advertising
    would have less great content in it than a world with. However, it seems likely. Regardless, we
    live in a world with substantial advertising infrastructure invplace, and, happily, that
    infrastructure is able to provide financial support to many great journalists and artists and
    adventurers and athletes.

Perhaps not surprisingly, it seems that when most people are asked this question they immediately
think about public service ads such as anti-smoking or AIDs awareness campaigns. I agree, but I
happen to think that those are simply instances of 1 and 2.
