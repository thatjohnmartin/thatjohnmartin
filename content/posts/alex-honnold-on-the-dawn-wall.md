Alex Honnold, in a Q&A with Men's Journal about the Dawn Wall climb that Tommy Caldwell and Kevin
Jorgeson are close to sending, on what's it's like to live on wall for many days:

> I've been on [El Capitan] for four or five days trying to free routes but I've never been on the
> wall for two weeks. That's kind of like a different level. What people maybe don't appreciate is
> how hard it is to be living on a wall. I mean they haven't walked in two weeks. They've just been
> laying and standing and pulling really, really hard on small holds. So the fact that they've had
> to recover and stay well-fed and hydrated and take care of their bodies while just like laying in
> a cot. Imagine getting out of your hospital bed and doing like the hardest rock climbing that's
> ever been done and then getting back on your hospital bed. Like, 'oh, now it's time to recover.'
> It's not like taking a shower and stretching and taking a stroll for a little a bit. It's hard
> living.
