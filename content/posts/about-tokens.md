I'm working on a [new crypto project][measure] so it's going to get pretty blockchainy around here.

To lay some groundwork, I highly recommend reading through Nick Grossman's recent presentation on [Why Tokens Are Fundamental][nick]:

> "Cryptonetworks" can help us build a more competitive, innovative, secure and decentralized Internet. "Tokens" (also known as
> cryptocurrencies or cryptoassets) are integral to the operation of cryptonetworks.  As we design new laws and regulations in
> this emerging space, we should keep these concepts in mind, beyond the financial aspects that are todayâ€™s primary focus.

It's a good followup to Joel Monegro's seminal post on [Fat Protocols][fat].
