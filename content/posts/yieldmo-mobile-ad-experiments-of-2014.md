Yieldmo summarizes their top 5 mobile ad experiments of 2014. These are all really interesting veins
to mine: intentionality, engagement, viewability, urgency, and user interruption.

_Intentionality_ is incredibly important in mobile. I suspect that the accidental click problem is
much larger than any of us want to admit.

However, what I'm really encouraged by is the inclusion of _user interruption_:

I think user experience, holistically, is the biggest opportunity in digital advertising, mobile or
otherwise. Furthermore, I suspect that, in the short/medium term, there is more easy ground to be
taken in identifying and avoiding negative user experiences than there is in doubling down on
positive experiences. But these are two sides of the same coin and so any real progress here,
whether towards positive experiences or away from negative ones, is more than welcome. I have a lot
more to say about this topic, but I'll leave that for another day.

I think Yieldmo are my favorite ad tech startup right now.
