However, it doesn't diminish the heft of social channels, the size, firstly, and the nuances of user interaction, secondly

> You can see this most clearly on Facebook. Facebook calls itself a social medium, but its advertising model is good old-fashioned paid advertising plastered all over the page. Compare the number of paid ads you see on your Facebook page with the number of "conversations about brands."
