Last week, Dr Dobbs, the respected, elder statesman of programming journals, announced that they
were closing:

> Why would a well-known site, dearly loved by its readers and coming off a year of record page
> views, be sunset by its owner?
>
> In one word, revenue. Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and
> revenue, almost all of it from advertising. Despite our excellent growth on the editorial side,
> our revenue declined such that today it's barely 30% of what it was when I started. While some
> of this drop is undoubtedly due to turnover in our sales staff, even if the staff had been
> stable and executed perfectly, revenue would be much the same and future prospects would surely
> point to upcoming losses. This is because in the last 18 months, there has been a marked shift
> in how vendors value website advertising. They've come to realize that website ads tend to be
> less effective than they once were. Given that I've never bought a single item by clicking on
> an ad on a website, this conclusion seems correct in the small.

This is too much whimper and not enough bang for such a great, old property. I'll miss it.

It points at the larger cosmic shame of advertising suitability, which is that there is very little
correlation between the quality or worthiness of a piece of content or property and its suitability
for advertising.
