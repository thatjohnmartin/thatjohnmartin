This piece from [Rob Norman](http://twitter.com/robnorman) of GroupM is so spot on it hurts:

>From budget allocation to optimization, from data driven insight to creative development; choices and sources are abundant. There is no single source anything but instead a screaming demand for channel (and vendor) specific creative assets for delivery and discovery together with intra and inter channel allocation, optimization and attribution.
>
>The truth is that creative assets made for TV don't work as well on Hulu, worse on YouTube and sometimes not at all on Facebook. Assets created for Facebook don't necessarily deliver on Instagram or Pinterest, and Vine is from Mars and SnapChat from Venus.
>
>As for media, every platform will claim ROI that is sometimes hard to fathom. 3X from you, and you and you too? It may be true that the auction levels the negotiation playing field but allocation among channels and attribution across them never goes away.
