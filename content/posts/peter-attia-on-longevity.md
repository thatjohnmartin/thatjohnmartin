Peter Attia, ridiculously credentialed and all-around interesting nutrition/health/performance guy,
was on a recent episode of the The Tim Ferris Show. Lots of interesting stuff. In particular, I
liked his off-the-cuff summary of the aspects of life extension (a.k.a. death avoidance):

> nutrition, exercise, sleep, supplements, hormone modulation, pharmacology, and stress management

Clearly, I've got lots of work to do.
