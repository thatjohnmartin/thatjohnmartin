VentureBeat write about a new piece of research Nielsen and AOL have released on how attention plays
into the consumption of TV and online video and how that relates to ad effectiveness.

(This is a topic that is close to us at YuMe, in fact, we've
[done a bunch of research with IPG on it][yume-research].)

The results are mostly obvious – we all play with our mobile devices while we watch TV and
as a result pay less attention to the ads – but there are interesting and specific numerics. The
recommendations, however, are pretty depressing:

1. Run more impressions of the same ad (as high as 80% more).
2. Use audio cues in television ads to wrest our attention from our mobile device.

These are logical, I guess, but are only going to make the problem worse. Nobody wants the TV to
start shouting at them. Repeatedly.

More data is [available at AOL's site][aol-research].
