He's a bull on Uber and Google home automation, a bear (relatively) on Apple Pay and China, and he
has two things to say about ad tech.

The first, on the likelihood of Google changing their privacy policy to allow a more robust defence
against Facebook's new Atlas data/tech sandwich:

> It will take time for Atlas to grow into meaningful market share, but advertisers love high
> quality personalization, and that’s what Facebook offers. Google’s in a difficult position here 
> – its privacy position was crafted for a world where there was no meaningful competition in web
> advertising. Now there is. The phrase to watch is this one: _"We will not combine DoubleClick
> cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent."_

The second, on his generally positive outlook on ad tech as a sector:

> Adtech, a sector that took a beating this past year, will once again be seen as a strong,
> investable market. The sector has matured, and is no longer dominated by one-note business models
> dependent on a culture of fraud. This trend has already begun to play out with acquisitions in
> 2014 – LiveRamp, Datalogix, Blue Kai come to mind. With major players like Oracle, Salesforce,
> Facebook, Adobe, SAP, IBM and Google battling it out over marketing automation, it’ll be a very
> good year to be a differentiated adtech startup.
