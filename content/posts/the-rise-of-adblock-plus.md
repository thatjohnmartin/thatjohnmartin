Frédéric Filloux of Monday Note deftly disects the rise of AdBlock Plus, the shitty advertising that
feeds it, and the somewhat-beside-the-point legal action that French and German publishers are
taking against AdBlock Plus creator, Eyeo GmbH:

> One, a single private entity cannot decide what is acceptable or not for an entire sector.
> Especially in such an opaque fashion.
> 
> Two, we must admit that Eyeo GmbH is filling a vacuum created by the incompetence and sloppiness
> of the advertising community’s, namely creative agencies, media buyers and organizations that are
> supposed to coordinate the whole ecosystem (such as the Internet Advertising Bureau.)
>
> Three, the rise of ad blockers is the offspring of two major trends: a continual deflation of
> digital ads economics, and the growing reliance on ad exchanges and Real Time Bidding, both
> pushing prices further down.
