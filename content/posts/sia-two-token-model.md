1/ Sia, a decentralized storage network, describes their two-token model in this post: https://blog.sia.tech/the-ico-paradox-and-how-to-fix-it-3bfc61bc6eb8

2/ They have a utility token for using the network and a revenue-sharing token for sharing in the revenue generated by the network. I quite like this model but I disagree that itâ€™s obviously better than single-token models.
